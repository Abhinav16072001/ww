          When's the last time you've had a Coca Cola? It had been a while for me,
          but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I
          became reaquainted with the combination of carbonated water and artificial flavours.
          Coca cola are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a others flavored
          carbonated water. The Coca Cola at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe
          they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice drink alternative
          for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine.

            Sting Energy Drink is a carbonated energy drink from PepsiCo International and produced by Rockstar Inc. Sting is available in three flavours, such as original Gold Rush, Gold, Power Pacq, Power Lime and Berry Blast.
            They have little bites 
            to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's
            not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.

            I can't tell you whether 7 Up has a particularly amazing lime drink, only
            because 7 Up is the only drink I've ever ordered as lime flavour. I'm not
            even totally sure I know what a lemon flovoured drink is supposed to taste like. What I
            do know is the 7 up I ordered on a whim from here was delicious.

          When's the last time you've had a Ice tea? It had been a while for me,
          but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes.
          Iced tea is a form of cold tea. Though usually served in a glass with ice, it can refer to any tea that has been chilled or cooled. It may be sweetened with sugar, syrup and/or apple slices.
          It is also very refreshing.
